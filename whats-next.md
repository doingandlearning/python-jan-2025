# Further Reading and Next Steps in Python

Congratulations on completing the Intro to Python course! üéâ Here‚Äôs a list of resources and next steps to help you build on what you've learned, especially if you're interested in machine learning, sentiment analysis, and using Python with AWS.

## üìö Recommended Reading & Resources

1. **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**

   - This book focuses on using Python to simplify and automate daily tasks. It's excellent for reinforcing Python basics and learning practical applications.
   - [Read the book online](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) for free!

2. **Real Python**

   - Real Python offers tutorials, video courses, and in-depth articles on Python. Their content covers beginner to advanced topics and includes real-world examples.
   - [Explore Real Python](https://realpython.com/)

3. **Python Morsels**
   - Python Morsels provides bite-sized exercises to help you build Python skills. Each challenge is geared toward deepening your understanding of Python fundamentals and expanding your problem-solving abilities.
   - [Visit Python Morsels](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/)

4. **Python Workouts** by Reuven Lerner

## üìà Getting Started with Machine Learning & Sentiment Analysis

I'd probably start here, https://realpython.com/python-nltk-sentiment-analysis/, with a Real Python tutorial. It steps through each of the main steps and has good explanations. After that, if you are still interested I'd explore some of the following.

1. **Intro to Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn**

   - [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is a powerful library for machine learning in Python. Start with their user guide to explore topics like regression, classification, and clustering.
   - For practical tutorials, check out the [Real Python machine learning series](https://realpython.com/tutorials/machine-learning/).

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Sentiment Analysis**

   - [NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)](https://www.nltk.org/) and [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/) are great libraries for starting with NLP and sentiment analysis in Python.
   - Consider a beginner project like building a sentiment analysis tool for product reviews or social media posts.
   - Kaggle also has sentiment analysis datasets and tutorials that can help you practice your skills:
     - [Sentiment Analysis on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

3. **Deep Learning with TensorFlow and PyTorch**
   - For more advanced machine learning, [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) are popular frameworks.
   - Consider online courses like:
     - [DeepLearning.AI's TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice) on Coursera.
     - [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) offers practical, hands-on courses with PyTorch.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Working with AWS SDK (Boto3)

Again, there's a Real Python tutorial to start you off here, https://realpython.com/python-boto3-aws-s3/ - you'll need to have access to an AWS account but there is a generous free tier to experiment with.

1. **AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)**

   - [Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) is the official AWS SDK for Python. It allows you to interact with AWS services like S3, EC2, and Lambda.
   - Start with the Boto3 documentation and try beginner projects, such as uploading files to an S3 bucket or launching an EC2 instance.

2. **AWS Free Tier**

   - The AWS Free Tier provides limited usage of services at no cost for one year. It‚Äôs a great way to gain hands-on experience with AWS.
   - [Learn more about the AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

3. **AWS Certifications and Training**
   - AWS offers training paths for various roles, including Developer, Solutions Architect, and Machine Learning Engineer. These paths can be valuable for deepening your AWS skills.
   - [AWS Training and Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/training/)

## Matplotlib and Pandas


## Django


## üéØ Suggested Next Steps

1. **Build Projects**

   - Apply your skills by building small projects. For example:
     - A simple web app for sentiment analysis.
     - A command-line tool for managing files on AWS S3.
     - A machine learning model that makes predictions based on real data.

2. **Look for opportunities**
   As you head back into work, look for places where you are repeating tasks or doing something monotonous. Think about the problems you're solving and break them into smaller pieces. Can some or all of them be solved with code?

3. **Experiment and Explore**
   - Python‚Äôs versatility allows you to experiment in many areas. Continue exploring libraries and frameworks, build on your interests, and challenge yourself with new projects.

Happy coding, and good luck on your Python journey! üöÄ
